### See you in NY and Singapore! Monthly Report 2020/March

Long time no see, I`m not able to send monthly reports from Shenzhen, because too much trip.

Now I`m in Bangkok, Thailand for Holiday, I enjoyed last two weeks in Myanmar and Thailand. So surprising in Yangon, I saw few so active Maker Space there. I got interested in a marker event in Yangon next 2021 Jan.

And I did 15 times lecture in WASEDA Univ in Japan. I`m an associate lecturer there, talk about Mass innovation from Shenzhen. I invite some guest talk in my lecture, you can see our friend, Jie Qi talk about MIT Media Lab / TODAI in Shenzhen and the story of her.
