终极闭幕创客派对AkiParty 1.0 YOU ARE (NOT) ALONE@Maker Faire深圳

Shenzhen Huaqiangbay are 3000% bigger than Akihabara. But I can’t find any DIY Manga shop and Anime shop in there.  
Therefore, We will bring our culture bring to Shanzhen, and Rip, Mix, Burn in Shenzhen, Make new party at Makers Hollywood.

Lets make dance with world makers, such as Dale Dougherty​, Joey Hudy​ , Shigeru Kobayashi​ , Kyunkun​ , Sae Toriena Shimizu​ , コバルト爆弾αΩ​ , William Hooi​, Pattaraporn Bodhisuwan​, 明和電機​.

We Makers are all different and all Wonderful. We can Dance together!

Shout from Eric Pan, We are the future!  
Dance with Massimo Banzi, Tom Igoe….  
That is makers dance party!
