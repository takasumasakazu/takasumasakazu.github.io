### Why Shenzhen became innovative city from Copycat city,suddenly?

I have the most participation in the world of Asian Maker Faire. Compared with other makers of other countries, the Chinese maker Fair has a strong character to exhibit in the down of a product that is likely to sell (many of them). I have felt that I have not seen much of the creativity and originality that I made because I wanted to make it. However, the maker Fair Shenzhen 2017 felt the sign that it was changing.

**An inventor Baohua who makes water walking equipment “stray” was influenced by the novel .**

The great attention was the tool for the new sport of walking on water, this “stray water”. An inventor named Baohua and an entrepreneur exhibited it.

The board arranged like the comb becomes like one board when sinking in water, the resistance grows, and the resistance decreases when raising it from water. It takes a few seconds to sink, and it makes the state “momentarily to raise it” though it sinks in the end in a few seconds even if there is some resistance because it is not easy to sink because it is not buoyancy. So, before the right leg goes down, pull the left leg out before the left leg before the sink… It is possible to walk on water if the Act is continued.  
Of course, there are many other efficient ways to make a boat float. This is a kind of play and sport.

Looking at the actual thing of “water floating” exhibited, each part seems to be a low technology bound with a string, but the whole is full carbon which is difficult to process, the weight is as light as 5 kg in total left and right, it takes a long time and effort I can feel the seriousness of the producer.  
Even seriously, inventor BaoFua thinks this as a “new sports”, starts dissemination activities, has started-up entrepreneurs. You can see movies and presentations here.

Originally inspired by Chinese traditional hero novels which walk on the water appeared, it is said that it tried to actually make it.  
Regardless of whether he will succeed as an entrepreneur, I think that it is an original idea. From such an approach that searches for business seeds earlier, such inventions are hard to come out.

### **A work that was influenced by animation, a project that started from play**

  


What I am riding with delight is created by being influenced by the giant robot “Strand Beast” moving in the wind of Dutch inventor Theo · Jansen. The system and the purpose differ from wooden, electric gimmicks and original with the system and purpose (the original strand beast moves with the wind, the author says “I want to make a new creature moving only with natural energy”), but characteristic feet The structure remains unchanged.

  
Mr. Chen Kuhei of the robot writer who made the work also makes works that made various mechanisms robots.  
This is a picture of the rock ‘s foot mechanism which appears in “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind” in the picture. In case  
When I showed the image of the royal cheeks with a smartphone, they responded “This is me!”….
