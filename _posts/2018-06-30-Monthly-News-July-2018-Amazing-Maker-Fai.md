I will back to Shenzhen on 10th July.

This trip I saw a couple of Maker Faire, Barcelona and Prague. My first step in Barcelona was a fantastic experience, I fall in love with that city. The tech activity is few, not my style and so far from Shenzhen. However, I saw Fablab Barcelona, Green Fablab, SOKO maker space, these looks well.

I really respect to Joseph Prusa, Denisa Kara and the all of the staff.

Finally, I head up to Maker Faire Tokyo and Singapore.

I spend a so much time for AKIPARTY 2018, on 4th August at AKIHABARA Tokyo.
