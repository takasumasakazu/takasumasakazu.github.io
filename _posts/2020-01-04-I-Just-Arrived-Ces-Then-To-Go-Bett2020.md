After CES, I will be Maker Faire Bangkok on 18th-19th Jan. Then to go other event on UK, BETT 2020.  
After BETT, I will go again Tokyo and give the 2 weeks Lecture at WASEDA university about Maker Ecosystem and Shenzhen.

That university lecture is good experience for me, talking a lot to students who want to lean MBA course, I also inspired from the student.  
This year, I invite Jie Qi from MIT Media Lab for guest speakers to my lecture. She now works at Tokyo University, we will share the experience about the Media Lab Shenzhen project.

You can more easy to add and remove from my email.

If you come CES, BETT, or Maker Faire Bangkok, or my lecture on Waseda Univ, lets chat and take selfie with me.

Best
