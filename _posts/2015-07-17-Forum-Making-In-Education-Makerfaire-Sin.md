Saminathan Gopal, Pricipal, STEM Inc Making in Education MakerFaire Singapore 2015

I saw a lot of STEM works in Singapore. These everything so nice, Mostly meritocracy culture in Education.

T Meng Lim​ told about STEM INC,  
-STEM INC was set up in the Science Centre Singapore when we were entrusted to develop and implement STEM Applied Learning Program in our secondary schools.  
I named it STEM Inc because I want to convey to our students that when they know how to apply STEM with innovation and creativity (InC) they acquire the Power to create solutions and maybe an enterprise or a company (Inc). May we see our youth empowered through STEM n see the relevance of science n maths classes to the real world challenges. For that reason STEM Inc employs qualified engineers and scientists as curriculum specialists bringing real world into the classroom. Importantly the program has no examinations for students. They learn because they see relevance n applications and loving it!
