Maker Faire Singapore 2015 digest

I really like that video, Maker Faire Singapore 2015 digest.

Here Singapore is a very small country, only 5.5million population in whole of the nation. Bit difficult to find a tech enthusiast such as Tokyo, difficult to find cool startup such as Shenzhen.

But you can see a lot of enjoy making kids and females in there.

MFSG is provided from Ministry of Education, we focused on kids and parents Maker Faire.

We started with kids and parents 5years ago.

But Maker culture in Singapore glowing very first, We have over 30 maker spaces in this red dot on the map’s nation. In 2015, our Maker Faire reached with Hobby DIY enthusiast group in the world. Some DIY group in Singapore and worldwide, making the booth in there.

During this year, we will make Maker Faire with Singapore Univercity Technology and Science.
