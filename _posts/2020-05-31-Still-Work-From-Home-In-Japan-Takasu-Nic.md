Surprisely, I was in Japan whole of the month! I had been on the aircraft hundred times per year in last 4–5years. I couldn`t imagine I stayed home whole of the month such as childhood days.

However, China and Japan also other Asian counties Covid-19 situation`s are getting better week by week. I still work from home and waiting next trip to overseas. I guess I have to wait more 1–2 months.

But Japanese maker communities are still made something for the joy. I support to Civic-Tech activities in Japan.

BTW, I heard many awful news around US and Euro. I really hope to stay healthy in the home, and see you again somewhere`s maker event on the globe.

Hope to see you again soon, keep a positive mind, go forward to open innovation.
