### Notable Maker Mr. Higekita, His DIY 3D planetarium is unforgettable project.

Higekita is natural bone makers. He bore at Kanazawa prefecture, north part of Japan, his grandfather is Carpenter and father is a fisherman. He spends a time for Making by papers, cardboard mini car, paper plane when his childhoods.

This story Idea from his [blog](http://higekita.wixsite.com/kilostar/single-post/2015/10/21/%E3%83%92%E3%82%B2%E3%82%AD%E3%82%BF%E4%B8%80%E4%BB%A3%E8%A8%98).

Higekita is natural bone makers. He bore at Kanazawa prefecture, north part of Japan, his grandfather is Carpenter and father is a fisherman. He spends a time for Making by papers, cardboard mini car, paper plane when his childhoods.

He saw Appollo 11 landings on the moon when his elementary school, he got interested in the moon and the universe from Appollo.

His the first time DIY planetarium is when his university student, what is made with thousands of small holes in aluminium bowl by a tiny hand drill. He spends a whole of the week for that tough work. But the result is not so good.

In 1985, Science Expo in Tsukuba, Japan, he saw a big 3D dome movie at Fujitsu pavilion. That movie was made by hundred of super computers.

He very inspired that and want to make himself. He have done already, but didn’t have any computer.

He imagined 3D by red and blue glass. And that time his hobby was miniature planet and planet shadow in amateur astronomy club. Two projectors and 3D glass will make DIY 3D planetarium? But how to use double projects, and a fish eye lens? These are never know the project, looks that difficult and project is expensive when 1980s’

In some day, He suddenly found it when he heads up public bath, He saw the double shadow from two Street light. THAT IS EUREKA! Not need fish eye lens, only two light bulbs!

He back to his room, and try that with light bulb, red and blue cellophane, miniature planet, he has everything!

He imagined 3d shadow show at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, that have original story.

In 1920, Hammond is as known as the inventor of Hammond organ who made the 3D dance system that dancer behind red and blue colored tube light and follow semi transparent screen, Hammond also makes 3D movie theater by mechanical shutter.

Higekita’s one is for dome to these Hammond’s idea.

Computer graphics by ray tracing that need high power computing for simulation of light and refraction, but his analog 3D system is the same result in directly.

He starts full time maker by that.
