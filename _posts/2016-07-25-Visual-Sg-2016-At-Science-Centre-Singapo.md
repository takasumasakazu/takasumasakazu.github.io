### Visual SG 2016 at Science Centre Singapore

Visual SG is a data visualization and VR event, a bit similar theme of SIGGRAPH.

The first day 22/June, we do the public reciter whole of the day, over 10 international speakers talk about the theme.

I recorded all video at the front row, but some speech couldn’t upload by copyright policy on YouTube.
