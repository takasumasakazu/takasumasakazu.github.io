This is Takasu,

I have left from Shenzhen for Chinese New Year, and also CES and BETT.  
After that, Now I`m in Japan for maker event. Then I will be in Tokyo for the Lecture, about Maker`s ecosystem, Maker Pro, Chinese IP system and DIY communities.

This is my first time, part-time lecture in WASEDA Univ, I prepare for 15 time talk in MBA and economy student, sounds a bit challenging. But I have interest about that, my DIY and grassroots attitude will discuss to MBA and economy student, I am really looking to see the new challenge for my brain.

After lecture, finally I got 2 week holiday, I`m planning to go Bohol island for only diving and re-fresh.

I will be back to Shenzhen at the end of Feb, and heads up to SXSW Austin.

See you there!
