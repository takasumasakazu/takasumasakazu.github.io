## Top picks at the Singapore Biennale

#### teamLab art get 1st.

1\. PEACE CAN BE REALISED EVEN WITHOUT ORDER by Team Lab (Singapore Art Museum). The Biennale’s best “wow” moment comes from this Japanese art collective, which takes over the museum’s third floor space. One enters the dark room and is immediately overwhelmed by what seems like an endless group of traditional musicians and dancers, holograms that react to your presence via motion sensors as you tentatively walk around and immerse yourself in its uplifting, celebratory vibe.
