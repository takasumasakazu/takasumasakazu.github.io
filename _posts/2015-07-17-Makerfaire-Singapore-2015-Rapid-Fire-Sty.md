03 Scottie Crafts — Alice

My passion for handicraft began in 2003 after I attended the Perth Royal Show in Australia. This annual community event showcases Western Australia’s agriculture, small businesses and entertainment and the wide array of exhibits include arts, handicrafts, animals, photography, local produce, cooking demonstration, performances as well as competitions. The wide variety of handicrafts on display left a deep impression on me. It was an eye opener as I discovered that one can create beautiful crafts using simple materials such as paper, ribbons, fabric and cinnamon sticks! I enrolled in handicraft classes and began making gifts for my family and friends and I have not looked back since. At ScottieCrafts, all the gifts and cards are created with love and can be customised or personalised according to your preferences. Feel free to email me at [scottiecrafts@gmail.com](mailto:scottiecrafts@gmail.com) for any queries or orders. Have a great day!

04 Paper Quilling — Priyanka

More about Priyanka can also be found at her “Just Love Crafts” [blog](http://justlovecrafts.blogspot.sg/) and [Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/justlovecrafts).

05 Chorustext

ChorusText aims to provide an alternative to conventional text editing and reading, by shifting the activity from visual-based to “tactile-and-audial-based.”

Instead of a screen, it has a surface populated with moving sliders, dials and buttons; And instead of staring at the screen to read the text, the user gets to physically slide knobs, turn dials and press buttons. The underlying software keeps track of the position of the knobs and status of the buttons, converts the text to synthesized speech accordingly, and plays it through the speaker. The result is a system that reads text in response to the user’s tactile / physical inputs. When the text changes,such as from insertion of new text typed from the keyboard, the sliders will also reposition themselves to reflect the new content of the text.

06 Hackerspace Singapore

Hackerspace.SG is Singapore’s very own Hackerspace.

There are hundreds of such hackerspaces around the world, where people with common interests in computers, technology, science, digital and electronic art, come together to meet, socialise and collaborate.

Built by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, Hackerspace.SG is the Singapore hacker community’s home, living room and laboratory. Come hang out with the community in the evenings. Co-work with us during the day. We also host regular events, meetups, presentations, workshops, and movie nights for the local community.

HSG was Singapore’s first co-working space. Since we launched, many more have appeared — see e27's list of co-working spaces in Singapore.
