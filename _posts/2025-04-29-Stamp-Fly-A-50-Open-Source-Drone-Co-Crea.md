**Why We Built Stamp Fly**

Professor Kohei Ito from Kanazawa Institute of Technology was searching for a programmable drone that could be used in the classroom. Existing products were either too fragile, too expensive, or closed-source. The team at M5Stack had previously attempted to launch a drone kit called Atom Fly — but it fell short in durability and functionality.

**What Went Wrong with Atom Fly**

The original Atom Fly had a lightweight frame made from PCB material, which cracked easily in test flights. The microcontroller, ATOM Lite, lacked enough I/O pins for sensor expansion. Attempts were made to reinforce the frame and improve firmware, but the platform couldn’t handle reliable, repeatable flight — especially in an educational setting.

**How Japan Revived the Project**

Japanese hardware hacker GOROman prototyped a hybrid: Atom Fly’s electronics inside a BETAFPV 65mm drone frame — a major upgrade in durability. Simultaneously, M5Stack released the M5Stamp S3, a smaller and more powerful board that enabled easier sensor integration. Professor Ito contributed deep expertise in flight control, and the firmware was made open-source to allow further development. Together, Japanese engineers and Shenzhen suppliers collaborated at startup speed to bring the kit to life.

**Inside the Stamp Fly Hardware**

Stamp Fly is powered by the ESP32-S3-based M5Stamp S3, paired with brushless motors, BETAFPV propellers, and a LAVA 1S battery. It connects via the M5ATOM Joystick — a custom-built controller with a screen that shows battery level and pairing status. And yes, even the controller is fully programmable.

**Where It’s Being Used Now**

Stamp Fly is now used in intensive five-day university classes to teach flight control and PID tuning. It’s also catching attention from the ArduPilot community and DIY drone builders. The kit is fully open-source, from firmware to PCB design, allowing remixing and deep learning.

**The Value of Cross-Border Open Hardware**

This project is a success story of hardware made fast in Shenzhen and refined by Japanese engineering. It shows how open-source principles and international maker culture can create real, scalable educational tools.
