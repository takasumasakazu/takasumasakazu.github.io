Otherwise, people often help each other for the purpose, indeed for the community. Vocaloid is only software, voice and simple character. Hence the creators add more story for the character. Now every famous Vocaloid has quite an attractive personality, more the every real singer. Meanwhile them Vocaloid personality is made by collaborative creation.

**Shared Personality  
** A real singer, such as Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga’s personality is belonging them. You can’t feel own Lady Gaga’s personality. In the case of some musician give the name to them music instrument, Eric Crapton calling his guitar Layla. Otherwise that guitar Layla’s only his one.  
Apart from, a Vocaloid is different. They have a personality from collaboration, and that software shared by each creator. Therefore them personality didn’t monopoly by anybody, every creator has own Singer. Vocaloid has both of apparently contradictory, they have shared personality.

#### Open collaboration ecosystem.

In conclusion, the people surrounding Vocaloid are making ecosystem. They helped each other for growing ecosystem. Additionally centre of ecosystem in attractive personality of Vocalid, that is not only software synthesizer but also character. As well as them character made by collaborative creation.  
That structure is a bit similar to open source projects, unless difference between a software and content.  
These are not a cathedral and not a bazaar, but another kind of open collaboration ecosystem.
