### What are Human and Humanity? I met Humanoid AI Robot Nadine.

I met Humanoid robot called Nadine. That is research project by Prof Nadia at [Instutitute for Media Innovation](http://imi.ntu.edu.sg/AboutIMI/Pages/vision.aspx), [Nanyang Technology University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx),Singapore

That robot project organized prof Nadia,that aim to make another new human being. Nadine have Artificial Intelligence brain, she can talk with human, and more leanning new thing from experience.   
Her eyes are still Kinect V2 Camera, also ears are a microphone, I have to grab a microphone when I speak to Nadia. However, these are just developing now for the communication.

“Nadine will have more predict hand by next project. She will be able to grab something and play a table game such as chess with human.” Prof Nadia told me. That means more deeply communication with human by hand.

Geminoid project by prof Kazuo Ishiguro is another famous humanoid project. I saw his project, I think that aim to ‘Copy’ the whole of The person to Robot, includes character, personality, and physical appearance.  
Instead of Nadine project, current Nadiene has similar prof Nadia’s appearance, but that personality is Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nadine project aiming to ‘New’ person.

Nadia’s lab made another AI robot too, without physical appearance, only in the display robot.

That AI robot on the display, some time interaction for me, smiling and move her hand and body. These are smoother than Nadine. Nadine need huge air compressor system, can’t go out her room, but that system is able to go around. That robot is not only Nadine limited version.

Prof. Nadine’s research projects cause more deelply thinking to WHAT IS A HUMAN.
