### Happy CNY, I`m still in Shenzhen. Feb/2021 monthly report

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*woiUBVjfVrQbI71eiHdptw.jpeg)I met Dr.Yin, She graduate from KANAZAWA university Japan, and working in Shenzhen goverment!

This is TAKASU.  
Long time no see!  
I`m in Shenzhen and happy busy days.

You know, the current Covid-19 situation is not so good, Here Shenzhen is the safest in the world, with only a few carriers per day in 15 million people. But China government announced so strict regulations about domestic transport, I`m not able to go out from Shenzhen. Of course, international trip too.

I agree with that announcement, the time has come for staying home. I will enjoy spring cleaning for my room and enjoy spring food from this fruitful area around southern China…

I hope to see you again and surely hope to stay safe.

Best  
Takasu
